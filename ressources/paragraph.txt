Biological research spans scales from molecules to systems to organisms, seeking to understand and design functional components across all domains of life (Darwin, 1859; Mendel, 1866; Dobzhansky, 1951). Creating a machine to design functions across the diversity of life would require it to learn a deep, generalist represen- tation of biological complexity. While this complexity surpasses straightforward human intuition, advances in artificial intelligence offer a universal framework that leverages data and compute at scale to uncover higher-order patterns (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020). We reasoned that training a model with these capabilities would require data spanning the full spectrum of biological diversity to discover emergent properties similar to those found in other fields (Radford et al., 2019).
